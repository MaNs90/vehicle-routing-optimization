# vehicle-routing-optimization
This code solves, optimizes, &amp; automates the warehouse vehicle routing problem by using Google's OR-Tools Library to distribute warehouse load between vehicles and routes them to clients in the fastest way possible while maintaining the system constraints.

The script relies on OR-Tools to solve the travelling salesman problem, as well as Open Routes Service (ORS) in order to calculate the distance matrix between the client's coordinates
